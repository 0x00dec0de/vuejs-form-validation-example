# Form Validation using Vue.js 2

![](http://i.imgur.com/scaI6kr.gif)

This is the source code for my tutorial on DotDev about form validation.

The validation is performed within [App.vue](https://github.com/hootlex/vuejs-form-validation-example/blob/master/src/App.vue) file.


If you want to run it, download the code of this repository and run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
